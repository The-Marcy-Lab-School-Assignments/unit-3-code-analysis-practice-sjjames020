Using markdown, identify what the following code block does and explain how the `forEach` function works.

```js
function forEach(arr, action) {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    action(arr[i]);
  }
}

forEach(['a', 'b', 'c'], console.log);
```

**Guiding Questions:**
* What does the code do (what does it print? are any variable reassigned? etc...)
* What are the expected data types for each of the parameters?
* When the function is invoked, what value are provided as arguments?
* How does `forEach` use the provided arguments?

**Key Terms to use**: parameters, arguments, invoke/invocation, iterate, "element of the array", increment,

Your explanation here...
--
This code prints `'a' 'b' 'c'`. First, this function uses a for loop to iterate through a given array. Inside the for loops block the parameter `action` is invoked and the array elements are being passed into the function.
